# Frontend Mentor - Profile card component

![Design preview for the Profile card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I take this challenge from Frontend Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges) to practise my coding skills!

Here you can see all my solutions at Frontend Mentor: https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/lttn-16

In this challenge, I use HTML CSS and Bootstrap. 

From this challenge, I've learned many things:

- Use Bootstrap card.
- Use background-image to make the background behind.

Thank you for reading! ðŸ˜Š
